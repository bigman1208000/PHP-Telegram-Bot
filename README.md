A Telegram Bot based on the official [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api)


## introduction
This is a pure php Telegram Bot, fully extensible via plugins. Telegram recently announced official support for a [Bot API](https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution) allowing integrators of all sorts to bring automated interactions to the mobile platform. This Bot aims to provide a platform where one could simply write a plugin and have interactions in a matter of minutes.


Instructions
============

1. Message @botfather https://telegram.me/botfather with the following text: `/newbot`
   If you don't know how to message by username, click the search field on your Telegram app and type `@botfather`, you should be able to initiate a conversation. Be careful not to send it to the wrong contact, because some users has similar usernames to `botfather`.

2. @botfather replies with `Alright, a new bot. How are we going to call it? Please choose a name for your bot.`

3. Type whatever name you want for your bot.

4. @botfather replies with `Good. Now let's choose a username for your bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: TetrisBot or tetris_bot.`

5. Type whatever username you want for your bot, minimum 5 characters, and must end with `bot`. For example: `telesample_bot`

6. @botfather replies with:

    Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at telegram.me/telesample_bot. You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands.

    Use this token to access the HTTP API:
    <b>123456789:AAG90e14-0f8-40183D-18491dDE</b>

    For a description of the Bot API, see this page: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api

7. Note down the 'token' mentioned above.

8. Type `/setprivacy` to @botfather.

9. @botfather replies with `Choose a bot to change group messages settings.`

10. Type `@telesample_bot` (change to the username you set at step 5 above, but start it with `@`)

11. @botfather replies with

    'Enable' - your bot will only receive messages that either start with the '/' symbol or mention the bot by username.
    'Disable' - your bot will receive all messages that people send to groups.
    Current status is: ENABLED

12. Type `Disable` to let your bot receive all messages sent to a group. This step is up to you actually.

13. @botfather replies with `Success! The new status is: DISABLED. /help`




## Installation
You need server with https and composer support.

Install this package through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Edit your project's `composer.json` file to require `longman/telegram-bot`.

Create composer.json file:
```js
{
    "name": "yourproject/yourproject",
    "type": "project",
    "require": {
        "php": ">=5.3.0",
        "longman/telegram-bot": "*"
    }
}
```
And run composer update

**Or** run a command in your command line:

```
composer require longman/telegram-bot
```

###### bot token
You will notice that the Telegram Bot wants a value for `API_KEY`. This token may be obtained via a telegram client for your bot. See [this](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) link if you are unsure of how to so this.


## Usage
You must set [WebHook](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook)

Create set.php and put:
```php
<?php

$loader = require \_\_DIR\_\_.'/vendor/autoload.php';

$API\_KEY = 'your\_bot\_api\_key';
$BOT_NAME = 'namebot';

try {
	// create Telegram API object
	$telegram = new Longman\TelegramBot\Telegram($API\_KEY, $BOT\_NAME);

	// set webhook
	echo $telegram->setWebHook('https://yourdomain/yourpath_to_hook.php');
}
catch (Longman\TelegramBot\Exception\TelegramException $e) {
	echo $e->getMessage();
}
```
And open your set.php via browser


After create hook.php and put:
```php
<?php

$loader = require \_\_DIR\_\_.'/vendor/autoload.php';

$API\_KEY = 'your\_bot\_api\_key';
$BOT_NAME = 'namebot';

try {
	// create Telegram API object
	$telegram = new Longman\TelegramBot\Telegram($API_KEY,$BOT_NAME);

	// handle telegram webhook request
	$telegram->handle();
}
catch (Longman\TelegramBot\Exception\TelegramException $e) {
	// log telegram errors
	// echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

If you want insert in database messages for further usage in commands, create database and import structure.sql and enable mysql support after object creation and BEFORE handle method
```php
<?php

$credentials = array('host'=>'localhost', 'user'=>'dbuser', 'password'=>'dbpass', 'database'=>'dbname');

$telegram->enableMySQL($credentials);

```
