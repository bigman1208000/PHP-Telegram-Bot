Contributing
-------------

Before you contribute code to php-telegram-bot, please make sure it conforms to the PSR-2 coding standard and that the php-telegram-bot unit tests still pass. The easiest way to contribute is to work on a checkout of the repository, or your own fork. If you do this, you can run the following commands to check if everything is ready to submit:

    cd php-telegram-bot
    composer update
    vendor/bin/phpcs --report=full --extensions=php -np --standard=build/phpcs .

Which should give you no output, indicating that there are no coding standard errors. And then:

    vendor/bin/phpunit

Which should give you no failures or errors. You can ignore any skipped tests as these are for external tools.

Example for a function or methods:  
```
/**
 * Get formatted date
 *
 * @param string $location
 *
 * @return string
 */
```

- Each file is provided with the following header:
```
/**

 *
 * (c) Avtandil Kikabidze aka LONGMAN <akalongman@gmail.com>
 *
 * For the full copyright and license information, please view the LICENSE
 * file that was distributed with this source code.
 */
```
- No empty line after class declaration
- No empty line after `<?php`
- Last element of a multi-line array must be followed by a comma
- One empty line after the docblock header
- Array elements and `use` statements should be written in a logical order, preferrably alphabetically
- Use [] instead of array()
- Use single quotes (`'`) for string
- Leave space in front and behind the concatenation operator `.`
